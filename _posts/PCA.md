The **principal component analysis** is one of the **dimensionality reduction techniques** widely used in Machine Learning. In a huge dataset, reduce the dimensions with minimal loss of information. Reducing dimensions will reduce the time and storage space required.
So, the main idea is to look for accurate data representation in a lower-dimensional space.

In this blog I'll explain PCA by implementing it from scratch on a real world dataset.
